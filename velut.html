                      <p>
                        When I was studying Latin at uni, I found it useful to keep an Excel spreadsheet of any vocabulary I came across. 
                        On occasions in my spare time, I have enjoyed writing poetry, most notably lyrics (in English) for a children’s 
                        musical drama-group, but I’ve also translated contemporary pop songs into Latin. I realised that if I compiled 
                        more Latin words — and wrote some nifty Excel formulae — I could create my own Latin rhyming dictionary. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So I wrote the Excel formulae that found rhyming words, kept adding more words, wrote more formulae to manage my 
                        words and find out more things about them, and three years later was close to 90,000 words. I named the file 
                        velut, which is Latin for &ldquo;just like&rdquo;, because rhyming is all about finding words that are 
                        &ldquo;just like&rdquo; a given word with respect to their endings. (And also it can be an acronym 
                        for &ldquo;Useful Tables of Excellent Latin Vocabulary&rdquo;.)
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In January 2019 I started my formal training in web development. I then had the skills and confidence to begin to try to make my velut into a website. An 80-megabyte Excel file may take several minutes to load or save, and no-one but me can access it. But if I exported the data to a Mongo database, and integrated it with a React frontend via an Express server, anyone with internet would be able to see the lists of rhymes, so anyone interested in writing Latin-language verse (I can’t be the only one) can do so. Perhaps more importantly, I’ve been really enjoying the mental challenge of figuring out new tech and going full-stack with it. Plus it all looks cool on my portfolio.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Therefore, with great delight I can announce that velut is now live on <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk" title="velut &mdash; a Latin dictionary">velut.co.uk</a>!

                        Words in <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk" title="velut &mdash; a Latin dictionary">velut</a> are spelt 
                        with the letters abcdefghiklmnopqrstuvxyz &mdash; j is always written as i, w does not appear. 
                        Any long vowel is marked with an macron (ĀāĒēĪīŌōŪūȲȳ). 
                        In words where the stress is ambiguous, the presence or absence of an acute accent will distinguish 
                        &mdash; e.g. “Tiberī” (dative of the river Tiber) is stressed on the first syllable, “Tib&eacute;rī” 
                        (vocative of the name Tiberius) is stressed on the second. I’ve also used diaereses 
                        (&auml;&euml;&iuml;&ouml;&uuml;&yuml;) on occasion.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Typing diacritics is not necessary: as long as the letters are right (and in the right order), 
                        <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk" title="velut &mdash; a Latin dictionary">velut</a> will find 
                        a word that matches. You may find the list of anagrams useful. You can also specify diacritics 
                        by typing a hyphen, full stop, or colon after a vowel needing a macron, acute, or diaeresis; 
                        thus Tibe.ri- will be interpreted as Tib&eacute;rī.

                        “Scansion” refers to whether the syllables of a word are classed as “long” or “short” in classical Latin poetry.
                        Long syllables (denoted by a macron ¯) theoretically take twice as long to pronounce as short syllables 
                        (denoted by a breve ˘), and the rhythm of ancient poetry comes from the arrangement of long and short syllables.
                        I assume that final vowels are not elided and I assume that any syllable that could be short is short.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “Perfect rhymes” are words that sound identical from the stressed vowel to the end, under strict classical pronunciation.
                        The ancient Romans didn’t care so much for rhymes (scansion was what they really valued), and, by the time mediaeval 
                        or Renaissance writers were composing Latin with rhymes, several vowels and diphthongs had converged in pronunciation,
                        so most rhyming Latin poets would have generally been a lot more permissive in their rhymes than I have been.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Scansion, rhymes, and anagrams are determined by my Excel formulae and JavaScript functions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The “lemma” (plural “lemmata”) of a word is the form you would find in a dictionary as the headword. A
                         given word may belong to multiple lemmata. Sometimes a word might even be multiple lemmata 
                         — for example in English “make” can be a verb lemma or a noun lemma — so I’ve chosen to distinguish 
                         by use of additional information (such as part of speech) in square brackets.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “Cognates” are lemmata that come from the same etymological origin.
