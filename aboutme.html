                I did Latin.
            </h1>
            <p>
                I studied Latin at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a>, graduating with a 2:1 master’s 
                in June 2018. My favourite module was on Latin prose composition, and I really 
                got into the nitty-gritty of the grammar.
            </p>
            <p>
                I managed to develop my coding in tandem with my linguistic skills by making an
                Excel file that stores, and returns detailed information on, more than ninety
                thousand Latin words. The information returned includes inflected forms,
                definitions, cognates, anagrams, rhymes, and links to online dictionaries.
                I’ve since made a <a href="./code.html#velut" title="velut — a Latin dictionary">website</a> with this functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my sub-honours years, I also studied Ancient Greek for two years and Classical
                Studies and Russian for a year each.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the curriculum, I was a regular member of the uni’s classics 
                society, and wrote several of the nerdier rounds in their pub quizzes.

            <p>
                <a href="https://theatreinthequarter.co.uk/" title="Theatre in the Quarter’s website">TiQ</a> is 
                a drama company in my hometown of Chester, focussed on giving musical on-stage 
                experiences to children and the local community.
            </p>
            <p>
                My capacities include poster-designer, programme-designer, lyricist, photographer, 
                and assistant-director. These roles have enabled me to develop technical skills 
                (e.g. in fine art, graphic design, and poetic metre), and also soft skills such 
                as self-confidence, leadership, and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I have so far designed 30 posters and 17 programmes (the 
                paper-items-sold-or-given-to-the-audience kind) and lyricized 19 songs.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I’ve volunteered with TiQ since 2012, but I was a member of their children’s group 
                Jigsaw Music Theatre for several years prior. For the full list of shows I’ve done 
                with TiQ, see <a href="https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/tiq-oeuvre/" title="My œuvre with Theatre in the Quarter and related groups">my TiQ œuvre</a>.
